# Self-owned early-import ordering experiment

This standalone Windows/MSVC x64 experiment answers one question: does an
in-memory first import arm a synthetic canary gate before the controlled
dependency's DllMain, the EXE TLS callback, and the EXE's main canary run?
It does not hook APIs, isolate files/HKCU, identify Minecraft's singleton,
separate brokers, or approve a provider. The marker graph is intentionally
small; success cannot establish order for every Windows/game dependency.

The controller only launches its **own absolute executable path**, suspended,
with a fixed internal child argument. It updates the resulting original process
handle via DetourUpdateProcessWithDll and resumes the original thread. There is
no target-path/PID option, process discovery, shell activation, cross-bitness
helper, game launch, service/driver operation, account access or product wiring.
The sibling compatibility DLL is fixed, and the output directory must be a
trusted build directory. This is not an authenticated production injector.

## Source and build boundary

Our receipt, controller, compatibility DLL and dependency marker are independently
authored. Import insertion uses a **test-only external Microsoft Detours source
dependency**, pinned to 1dbd4ea281d73d478aa8d09a8b83fbd265f715f7.
Nothing is downloaded or vendored by this target. CMake checks the external
checkout's revision/clean src and builds its static library directly; production
adoption is undecided. Retain the upstream checkout's LICENSE.md when handling
its source/artifacts. No Sandboxie code or runtime is used.

From an existing compatible developer environment, configure only this folder,
explicitly opting in and supplying the trusted pinned external checkout:

~~~powershell
cmake -S tooling/acceptance/windows/bootstrap-ordering -B workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build -A x64 -DBOOTSTRAP_ORDERING_TEST_ONLY=ON -DDETOURS_ROOT=C:/path/to/reviewed/Detours
cmake --build workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build --config Release
~~~

Build does not execute the experiment. A separately requested manual run is:

~~~powershell
& ./workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build/Release/bootstrap-ordering.exe --run-self-test
~~~

The target rejects arbitrary arguments and unsupported architectures. The fixed
compatibility import path currently requires ASCII; there is no lossy conversion
or alternate-path fallback. Keep source and build directories separate.

## Controls and receipt

Each case creates a fresh anonymous section; only that HANDLE is inherited through
the Win32 handle allowlist. The parent binds PID and creation FILETIME while the
child is suspended. Marker code validates them before using the fixed-size
receipt. The environment value transports a handle number; it is **not** a
production capability. The controlled child can write its receipt, so this is
cooperative instrumentation, not adversarial isolation evidence.

A failed normal-order result does not skip controls. A fatal API/transport error
stops the remaining cases and emits an incomplete-operation receipt:

| Case | Expected self-check |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | No import insertion; dependency/TLS/main all record an unarmed canary. This positive control detects missing instrumentation. |
| first-import | Attach and arm recorded once; all three canaries recorded after arm. Any early canary, missing marker, exit or timeout fails. |
| attach-failure | DLL returns FALSE during initial attach; child exits unsuccessfully and never reaches main. |
| missing-arm-timeout | DLL deliberately does not arm; all three canaries remain unarmed and main sleeps outside loader lock. Parent must detect timeout and stop only its own child. This intentionally insecure control is never a production fallback. |

Stages: 1=compat attach, 2=arm, 3=attach rejected, 4=arm suppressed,
5=dependency DllMain canary, 6=EXE TLS canary, 7=main canary.
Each event includes the observed arm bit. At most 16 records are accepted;
overflow, invalid stages and malformed transport fail. DllMain never waits
for a controller handshake or calls registry/COM/known-folder APIs.

The parent reads only after confirmed child exit, with bounded waits. Cleanup
uses the original process handle; no PID reopen or unrelated termination occurs.
Failure receipts distinguish incomplete operations and cleanup uncertainty.
JSON contains fixed stage/case labels and booleans/counts, with
providerReady=false and minecraft=NOT_EXECUTED. It emits no raw PID, FILETIME,
HANDLE, username, installed game path, credentials, caches or world contents.

No filesystem/registry operations are mediated: "canary" means a marker at a
would-be protected call site, and "arm" is a shared flag, not an installed hook.
This test cannot observe kernel accesses before notification, all loader work,
external authentication, other module/TLS graphs or enforcement under bypass.

## Evidence

Source authored and statically reviewed only. MSVC/CMake build, control execution,
ordering result and cleanup on Windows: **NOT_EXECUTED**. Record actual results
and exact source SHA in the existing planning/development.md handoff; a build
exit code or loaded DLL is not MC02 acceptance.
