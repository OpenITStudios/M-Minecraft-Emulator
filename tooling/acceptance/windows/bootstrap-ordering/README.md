# Self-owned early-import ordering experiment

This standalone Windows/MSVC x64 experiment answers one question: does an
in-memory first import arm a synthetic canary gate before the controlled
dependency's DllMain, the EXE TLS callback, and the EXE's main canary run?
The default ordering mode does not hook APIs. The separate mutex mode below
hooks a fixed mutex name and one synthetic file leaf. Neither mode isolates general filesystem/HKCU views, identifies
Minecraft's singleton, separates brokers, or approves a provider. The marker graph is intentionally
small; success cannot establish order for every Windows/game dependency.

The controller only launches its **own absolute executable path**, suspended,
with a fixed internal child argument. It updates the resulting original process
handle via DetourUpdateProcessWithDll and resumes the original thread. There is
no target-path/PID option, process discovery, shell activation, cross-bitness
helper, game launch, service/driver operation, account access or product wiring.
The sibling compatibility DLL is fixed, and the output directory must be a
trusted build directory. This is not an authenticated production injector.

## Source and build boundary

Our receipt, controller, compatibility DLL and dependency marker are independently
authored. Import insertion uses a **test-only external Microsoft Detours source
dependency**, pinned to 1dbd4ea281d73d478aa8d09a8b83fbd265f715f7.
Nothing is downloaded or vendored by this target. CMake checks the external
checkout's revision/clean src and builds its static library directly; production
adoption is undecided. Retain the upstream checkout's LICENSE.md when handling
its source/artifacts. No Sandboxie code or runtime is used.

From an existing compatible developer environment, configure only this folder,
explicitly opting in and supplying the trusted pinned external checkout:

~~~powershell
cmake -S tooling/acceptance/windows/bootstrap-ordering -B workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build -A x64 -DBOOTSTRAP_ORDERING_TEST_ONLY=ON -DDETOURS_ROOT=C:/path/to/reviewed/Detours
cmake --build workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build --config Release
~~~

Build does not execute the experiment. A separately requested manual run is:

~~~powershell
& ./workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build/Release/bootstrap-ordering.exe --run-self-test
~~~

The target accepts only the two fixed self-test switches and its internal child
argument, and rejects unsupported architectures. The fixed
compatibility import path currently requires ASCII; there is no lossy conversion
or alternate-path fallback. Keep source and build directories separate.

## Ordering controls and receipt

Each case creates a fresh anonymous section; only that HANDLE is inherited through
the Win32 handle allowlist. The parent binds PID and creation FILETIME while the
child is suspended. Marker code validates them before using the fixed-size
receipt. The environment value transports a handle number; it is **not** a
production capability. The controlled child can write its receipt, so this is
cooperative instrumentation, not adversarial isolation evidence.

A failed normal-order result does not skip controls. A fatal API/transport error
stops the remaining cases and emits an incomplete-operation receipt:

| Case | Expected self-check |
| --- | --- |
| baseline | No import insertion; dependency/TLS/main all record an unarmed canary. This positive control detects missing instrumentation. |
| first-import | Attach and arm recorded once; all three canaries recorded after arm. Any early canary, missing marker, exit or timeout fails. |
| attach-failure | DLL returns FALSE during initial attach; child exits unsuccessfully and never reaches main. |
| missing-arm-timeout | DLL deliberately does not arm; all three canaries remain unarmed and main sleeps outside loader lock. Parent must detect timeout and stop only its own child. This intentionally insecure control is never a production fallback. |

Stages: 1=compat attach, 2=arm, 3=attach rejected, 4=arm suppressed,
5=dependency DllMain canary, 6=EXE TLS canary, 7=main canary.
Each event includes the observed arm bit. At most 16 records are accepted;
overflow, invalid stages and malformed transport fail. DllMain never waits
for a controller handshake or calls registry/COM/known-folder APIs.

The parent reads only after confirmed child exit, with bounded waits. Cleanup
uses the original process handle; no PID reopen or unrelated termination occurs.
Failure receipts distinguish incomplete operations and cleanup uncertainty.
JSON contains fixed stage/case labels and booleans/counts, with
providerReady=false and minecraft=NOT_EXECUTED. It emits no raw PID, FILETIME,
HANDLE, username, installed game path, credentials, caches or world contents.

No registry operations are mediated. Only the selected synthetic file leaf below is redirected. In the default ordering mode,
"canary" means a marker at a would-be protected call site and "arm" is a shared
flag. In mutex mode the flag follows installation of all four native mutex/file hooks in one transaction.
This test cannot observe kernel accesses before notification, all loader work,
external authentication, other module/TLS graphs or enforcement under bypass.

## Real mutex-name translation on self-owned children

The optional `--run-mutex-self-test` mode reuses the same fixed executable,
early-import DLL and pinned external Detours. **NtCreateMutant and NtOpenMutant**
are now the single interception layer; the separate CreateMutexW/OpenMutexW
hooks have been removed. Existing Win32 W calls and explicit native calls use
that layer. This is original code; no Sandboxie code/runtime is imported.

Only the exact configured test basename from `Local\\MivubiMutexProbe_` and
the child's actual session BaseNamedObjects directory can map to the A/B suffix.
Counted UNICODE_STRING input is bounded; caller memory is not rewritten.
Absolute names and RootDirectory-relative names (including Local aliases) resolve
their parent through NtOpenDirectoryObject. CompareObjectHandles checks identity
against a retained handle to the child's session directory, rather than comparing
handle numbers or matching a basename in every directory. The already-loaded
system modules supply checked exports; missing exports/initialization reject
attach. No NtQueryObject on arbitrary handles, shared hierarchy creation, extra
service or driver is introduced.

Names outside that exact selection, unnamed calls, unsupported lengths/shapes
and unresolved/different parent contexts pass to the original API. This is
**not fail-closed mediation for arbitrary callers**. Selected calls copy
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES, preserving root/flags/security pointers and replacing only
the counted name. Native NTSTATUS is returned unchanged; entry LastError is
restored even when internal lookup/comparison changes it. Protected parameter
reads translate access violations into their native exception status.
The initialization/parent handles and hooks belong to this process-lifetime
fixture; no live DLL unload or authenticated production slot capability exists.

The private **version-4** receipt (1,000 bytes, not a product wire schema) carries
native/file masks and the file round/root handles. It still binds the original child PID/creation FILETIME,
slot/test name and seven explicitly inherited handles: section, four phase events,
logical directory and the slot's private directory. Both children hold
their own object while the parent holds the host logical object and checks the
A/B identities. Existing Win32 controls remain bitmask **127**: fresh/existing
create, recursive open, unnamed/missing behavior, access/inheritance flags and
raw-peer wait/cleanup.

Direct native controls in each child are bitmask **511**:

| Bit | Actual check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Absolute native open resolves to the Win32-owned private object. |
| 2 | Relative directory-handle and Local-alias opens reach that same object. |
| 4 | Counted name ignores a non-terminator tail; caller string/attributes remain unchanged. |
| 8 | OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE opens the selected object; case-sensitive lowercase returns name-not-found. |
| 16 | OBJ_OPENIF duplicate create returns STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_EXISTS and honors OBJ_INHERIT. |
| 32 | Unnamed native create remains a distinct usable object. |
| 64 | Limited access/inheritance is honored, wait is denied without SYNCHRONIZE, and missing open preserves native name-not-found. |
| 128 | Same basename under the unrelated KnownDlls directory is not redirected. |
| 256 | Invalid name-buffer access returns STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION, without changing LastError. |

Every direct native API check captures LastError immediately. These are narrow
cooperative controls, not proof of every invalid input, ACL/security descriptor,
handle race, abandonment or hostile bypass. The controller still requires exact
early-import canary ordering, normal child exits and disappearance of both
backing objects. Same-user raw peer access **still succeeds**.

Manual invocation, separately from the four ordering controls:

~~~powershell
& ./workspace/bootstrap-ordering-build/Release/bootstrap-ordering.exe --run-mutex-self-test
~~~

Receipts retain providerReady=false, minecraft=NOT_EXECUTED and
securityBoundary=false. ANSI/Ex variants, other object types, inherited/duplicated
handle containment, general filesystem/HKCU views, real game hooks and singleton/auth behavior
remain outside this slice. Real cache/input/diagnostic names are never selected.

[NtOpenDirectoryObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/ntopendirectoryobject).
The native export may change/unavailable on future Windows; successful checks on
this host do not establish universal OS compatibility.

## Coherent synthetic file backing — 24 October 2026 WIB

The same mutex pair command runs two generations against one newly created TEMP
root. Only fresh HOST/OUTSIDE/A1/B1/A2/B2 markers are read or written; no existing
host/game/account/cache/world file is opened. The tiny synthetic tree is preserved
locally, without recursive cleanup. CreateDirectory and CREATE_NEW refuse existing
test directories/files.

NtCreateFile/NtOpenFile route exactly state.bin under the configured logical
directory into the same slot's A/B directory. All four mutex/file hooks install
atomically. Selected absolute NT device/DOS and directory-handle relative names
share the mapping. Relative roots use volume/file ID, not handle number.
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES is copied; access/share/disposition, allocation/EA/options and
IO_STATUS_BLOCK go to the original API. Forwarded NTSTATUS and entry LastError
are preserved. Actual read/write handles refer to private backing: a missing
private file stays missing, with no copying or fallback from logical HOST.

Attach rejects missing/non-directory/reparse roots, case-sensitive roots,
non-ASCII/oversized canonical paths, identical directory IDs, or a private
directory other than the expected A/B sibling of logical. One receipt.slot
selects both file backing and mutex suffix. An A-to-B binding fails before
Armed/main. Parent directory handles omit delete sharing.

This is a narrow cooperative slice. Within recognized logical roots, other
leaves/subpaths/streams and selected DELETE, owner/DACL, execute, directory,
delete-on-close, open-by-ID or open-reparse requests return STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED.
Policy rejection does not synthesize IO_STATUS_BLOCK. Unrecognized roots/aliases
pass through. Leaf reparse/hardlink attacks, handle rename/delete, inherited or
duplicated data handles, Unicode/general path policy, directory enumeration,
filesystem identity presentation, read COW and adversarial race containment are
not implemented. Same-user direct private backing access remains possible;
securityBoundary=false. Root metadata/initialization calls in this controlled
import experiment do not establish general loader/Windows-version compatibility.

File mask **127**, per child per generation:

| Bit | Actual check |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | First private open is missing despite HOST existing; relaunch reads the previous slot marker. |
| 2 | Win32 create/open, write, truncate and flush use private backing. |
| 4 | Absolute native open returns success/FILE_OPENED, preserves LastError and reads own marker. |
| 8 | Counted relative native OPEN_IF preserves caller input, inheritance, IO information and read-only access. |
| 16 | DELETE access and a different protected leaf are rejected without a file handle. |
| 32 | Unselected synthetic outside file passes through unchanged. |
| 64 | After both processes are ready, each still reads its own marker. |

The parent independently reads A/B and unchanged logical HOST/OUTSIDE while both
children hold files/mutexes and after normal exit, in both generations. Existing
mutex masks and early-import marker order remain required. Device-form mapping
is implemented; the explicit absolute native test uses DOS form. This is not
effective Minecraft Roaming/Local/Known Folder, HKCU or helper authentication.

Configure and Release build with /W4 /WX succeeded. Pinned external Detours
remained clean. Both commands returned native exit **0**:

- `--run-self-test`: all four original cases and summary selfCheck=true;
  baseline detected three early markers, normal detected zero, failed attach
  prevented main and the timeout control stopped its owned child.
- `--run-mutex-self-test`: both children reported bitmask **127**; controller
  verified distinct held host/A/B objects, each child's exact early-import
  marker order, normal exits, and disappearance of both backing mutexes.
- The deliberate raw peer open **succeeded**: rawPeerAccessible=true,
  securityBoundary=false. This is an observed limit of name translation,
  not a successful peer-access denial.
- Independent exact-image CIM check: **0** test processes remaining.
  Five ordering receipt rows and one mutex row validated. Evidence captured

### Executed on 23 October 2026

Exact fixture source: `d9a2fb80ad7ca362b4a9cb8a42cdb90e08cf88ae`.
All seven materialized source/readme blobs matched GitHub before compilation.
External Detours: clean `1dbd4ea281d73d478aa8d09a8b83fbd265f715f7`.
Windows x64 build 26100; CMake 4.3.2, MSVC 19.44.35226,
MSBuild 17.14.40. Configure and Release build succeeded with the committed
/W4 /WX settings. No source correction was needed for this build.

One explicit self-test run returned native exit code **0**:

| Case | Observed stages / arm bits | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | dependency, EXE TLS, main: all 0 | selfCheck=true; three unarmed canaries detected |
| first-import | attach(0), arm(1), dependency(1), TLS(1), main(1) | selfCheck=true; zero early canaries in this graph |
| attach-failure | attach(0), rejected(0); no main | selfCheck=true; failed attach prevented main |
| missing-arm-timeout | attach/suppressed/dependency/TLS/main: all 0 | selfCheck=true; timeout detected, owned child stopped with expected code |
| summary | SELF_CHILD_BOOTSTRAP_ONLY | selfCheck=true, providerReady=false, minecraft=NOT_EXECUTED |

The initial shell wrapper ended with status 1 from its empty Get-Process lookup;
the native test explicitly reported PROCESS_EXIT=0. A separate successful CIM
check found **0** remaining processes at the exact test-image path. Receipt
validation found exactly five rows, all self-checks true, no provider readiness
and no Minecraft acceptance. Verification recorded at 16:37 UTC / 23:37 WIB;
no game process was inspected or modified.

This establishes SOURCE_EXECUTION plus limited TARGET_WINDOWS evidence for the
specific self-owned synthetic graph and controls. It does not establish
universal loader ordering, installed hooks, actual private file/HKCU/IPC views,
Education singleton/broker compatibility, game injection or two/four-client
acceptance. Those remain **NOT_EXECUTED / UNKNOWN**. Current continuation belongs
only in `planning/development.md`.
